# Study Plan display for EPFL

Display a study plan from the EPFL website (for example for the [Computer Science Bachelor](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/bachelor/informatique/) in a way that allows one to isolate the courses for a given semester.
It helps give a better overview of what courses are available, instead of having every course of every semester mixed together.

For now, it serves a static HTML site where a script is added to the manually downloaded pages to choose how they are displayed. I plan to work on it further to have a backend automatically download and parse the pages for any study plan to then display it any way I choose (perhaps a custom frontend).
